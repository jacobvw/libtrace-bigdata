Libtrace bigdata is a real time passive packet analysis application that is
used with data visualization engines such as Kibana and Grafana to gain
insights on the usage patterns and performance of a network and its
applications. 

Libtrace bigdata works by capturing packets from a capture point and
passing each packet through flow, protocol and TLS decoders to form a result. 

Libtrace bigdata comes with a range of pre-built input plugins, filtering
plugins and output plugins which will satisfy most users needs. Libtrace
bigdata is a event driven application and provides an extensive API for
custom plugin development.
